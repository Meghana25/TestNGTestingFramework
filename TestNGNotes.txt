1.How to run tests with TestNG ? - You need to have @Test Annotation followed by methods
2.How to run these tests using TestNG.xml
3.You can run multiple tests in single fine using TestNG
4.testng.xml hierarchy : TestSuite -> TestFolder(Module) -> Testcases
5.Using TestNG , you can modularize the testcases based upon the functionality and trigger them accordingly
6.Using TestNG, you can also get a control on running specific methods from the test cases
7. we can include and exclude test case using regular expression like <exclude name="mobile.*"/>
8. TestNG Annotations:
	BeforeSuite
	BeforeTest
	BeforeClass
	BeforeMethod
	Test
	AfterMethod
	AfterClass
	AfterTest
	AfterSuite	

9. What is difference between BeforeTest and BestMethod?
BeforeTest -> It depends on testNG xml file based on the test folder scope
BeforeMethod -> specific to class file,and executes before each and every method	

10. In testNG, order of execution with same annotations happends in alphabetical order
	
11. Annotations helper attributes
	@Test(groups={Smoke})
	@Test(dependsOnMethods={"classname",classname1"})
	@Test(enabled=false)
	@Test(timeOut=4000)
	
12. Parameterizing
  1. Drive the data from xml file using below
	@Paramaters({"URL","key"})
	@Test
	
	
  2. using	DataProvider Annotation
  
	  @Test(dataProvider="getData")
	  @DataProvider
		public Object[][] getData()
		{
			//combinations(3) of username, password(2)
			//1st - good credit history
			//2nd - no credit history
			//3rd - fradulent credit history
			Object[][] data = new Object[3][2]; //Multidimensions object Array
			//1st - columns in the row are nothing but values for particular combination(row)
			data[0][0] ="firstsetusername";
			data[0][1] ="firstsetpassword";
			//2nd
			data[1][0]="secondsetusername";
			data[1][1]="secondsetpassword";
			//3rd
			data[2][0]="thirdsetusername";
			data[2][1]="thirdsetpassword";
			return data;
		}
* Global environment variables can be incorporated through selenium
* Parameterizing with multiple data sets by running tests with multiple combination

3. TestNG listeners Interface - listens to testcases
org.testng.ITestResult

This class describes the result of a test


13. PArallel execution
<suite name="Loan Department" parallel="tests" thread-count="2">
  <test name="personal loan" parallel="classes" thread-count="2">
